webRTCbuild-iOS
===============
1) Create a working directory

Make a new directory somewhere,  and get ready because youâ€™re going to need in the ballpark of 1.7 GB of free space
2) Download the Chromium depot tools

Switch into your working directory and grab the Chromium depot_tools repository with git:

git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git

These are a bunch of tools used during the build process, and they will need to be in your path so you will need to modify your .bash_profile (or other shell file) and modify the PATH line like so:

export PATH=/a_bunch_of_stuff:/working_directory/depot_tools:$PATH

Next you will need to restart your terminal or re-run your bash profile so that the changes take effect:

 ~/.zshrc

3) Download the WebRTC source
 
gclient config http://webrtc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk

(edit generated .gclient)  
target_os = ['ios', 'mac']

gclient sync --force
 
4) set up projects 
cd trunk

export GYP_DEFINES="build_with_libjingle=1 build_with_chromium=0 libjingle_objc=1"
export GYP_GENERATORS="xcode"
gclient runhooks
